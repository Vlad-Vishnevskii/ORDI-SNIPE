          wisp team is a group of independent developers, our goal is to provide
          a simple and affordable tool for automated market trading. Our native
          token, the White Wisp Token (WWT), is designed to be used in the
          trading system, allowing users to put it in staking or pay them
          directly. It is important to note that we have not reserved tokens for
          team members, nor do we have investors, advisors or other early
          holders. Our token will be fully hosted on a decentralized platform
          for efficient ecosystem management.
